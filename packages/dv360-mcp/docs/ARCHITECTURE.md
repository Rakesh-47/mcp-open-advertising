# dv360-mcp Architecture

How `dv360-mcp` is put together and why. For the repo-wide server pattern (tool definition files, session services, auth modes) see [CLAUDE.md](../../../CLAUDE.md); this page covers only what is specific to DV360. For the current tool list, read `src/mcp-server/tools/definitions/` or the fleet table in the root [README](../../../README.md).

## Request flow

1. The client connects over streamable HTTP (or stdio). In HTTP mode the `google-headers` auth strategy builds a Google auth adapter from the request's credentials; `jwt` and `none` are the other modes.
2. On a new session, `createSessionServices()` builds a `DV360HttpClient` around that adapter and a `DV360Service` on top of it. Tools reach them through `resolveSessionServices()`.
3. Tools call `DV360Service` (entity CRUD, duplication, custom bidding, targeting), which goes through `DV360HttpClient` to `displayvideo.googleapis.com`. Reporting is not here; it lives in `dbm-mcp`.

## Generic entity tools and the dynamic schema

DV360 has dozens of entity types. Rather than one tool per type, the entity tools (`dv360_create_entity`, `dv360_get_entity`, `dv360_update_entity`, …) take an `entityType`.

The full discriminated union of every entity schema is over 1 MB, which breaks stdio transport (EPIPE). So the tools register a **simplified** input schema, and the detail is served on demand as MCP resources:

| Resource URI                         | Contents                                          |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `entity-schema://{entityType}`       | Full JSON schema for the entity                   |
| `entity-fields://{entityType}`       | Required and optional fields                      |
| `entity-examples://{entityType}`     | Curated payloads with correct `updateMask` values |
| `targeting-schema://{targetingType}` | Schema for an assigned-targeting type             |
| `targeting-types://`                 | The supported targeting types                     |

Entity types are declared in `STATIC_ENTITY_API_METADATA` in `src/mcp-server/tools/utils/entity-mapping-dynamic.ts`: API path, the parent IDs the path needs, which IDs are query parameters, and parent-child relationships. Adding an entity type is one entry there; the schema, field and example resources follow from it.

## Generated schemas

`src/generated/schemas/{types,zod}.ts` come from Google's DV360 v4 Discovery document. Only the schemas the entity types need are extracted, which cuts the document from roughly 930 KB to roughly 190 KB. Both generated files are committed.

- Regenerate: `pnpm run generate:schemas` in this package. Configuration is `config/schema-extraction.config.ts`; the design is in [openapi-schema-extraction-spec.md](./openapi-schema-extraction-spec.md).
- Generation fetches the live Discovery document, so it is not part of `build`. The scheduled **Codegen drift** workflow (`.github/workflows/codegen-drift.yml`, `pnpm run check:dv360-codegen-drift`) compares the committed schemas with the live document weekly, so an upstream change shows up as a dated signal and does not break PR CI.

## Things that behave differently on DV360

- **Delete is a hard delete** for most entities. Line items must be archived first; archiving cannot be undone. See the dv360 note in CLAUDE.md.
- **`dv360_duplicate_entity`** always leaves the copy non-running (line items use the native `lineItems:duplicate`; insertion orders are copied GET → POST as `DRAFT`).
- **Writes are governed**: create, update, delete and duplicate carry the `cesteral.*` annotation and a native dry run, so `dryRun` returns the planned change without sending it.
