# Cesteral Docs

Navigation index for the `docs/` directory. Every file under `docs/` is reachable from this page, except the individual per-server reports in `reviews/2026-09-fleet-review/`, which are indexed by that folder's own README.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Start here for development:** [`../CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) covers architecture, commands, tool patterns, and the cross-cutting subsystems. The fleet overview (servers, API versions, tool counts) is in the root [`README.md`](../README.md).

### Design history and reviews

These are point-in-time documents. They record why something was built or what a review found; they are not kept current.

### Per-package docs

Package-specific docs live next to the package, not here. Each server with platform quirks also has a `packages/<server>/CLAUDE.md`, which Claude Code loads when working in that package; the root [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) lists them.
